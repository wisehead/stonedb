Support for MySQL 5.7

- Important Change: The Tianmu engine supports MySQL 5.7ï¼Œbase line edition MySQL 5.7.41. This change applies to the StoneDB database which would be fully compatible with the MySQL 5.7 protocols.

Functionality Added or Changed

- Important Change: The engine name  has been changed to tianmu. StoneDB is used as a HTAP database name, it is not suitable for used both as an engine name. As the dissusion result, we choose tianmu as our new eninge name: 

```bash
mysql> show engines;
+----------------+---------+--------------------------+--------------+------+------------+
| Engine         | Support | Comment                  | Transactions | XA   | Savepoints |
+----------------+---------+--------------------------+--------------+------+------------+
| TIANMU         | DEFAULT | Tianmu storage engine    | YES          | NO   | NO         |
+----------------+---------+--------------------------+--------------+------+------------+
```
- Tianmu:  Improved  the aggregation capabilities of the decimal data type. 
- Tianmu:  Improved the readability of code. The code does not spererate logically, or the variables name can not be understooed by the literal meaning. To refactor code make it more readable to anyone who are the first to read that. For example: Changes int DoGetSomething(); to int GetSomethingXXX();, int GetNoNulls() to int GetNumOfNulls().

- Tianmu: The date-related functions (such as DATE_ADD, DATE_SUB)  can be queried (DATE_ADD|DATE_SUB) when  creating view using the date func.([BUG #342](https://github.com/stoneatom/stonedb/issues/342))
