# Compile StoneDB for MySQL5.7 on CentOS 7

This topic describes how to compile StoneDB on CentOS 7.
## Precautions
Ensure that the tools and third-party libraries used in your environment meet the following version requirements:

- GCC 9.3.0
- Make 3.82 or later
- CMake 3.7.2 or later
- marisa 0.77
- RocksDB 6.12.6
- Boost 1.66

## Procedure
### Step 1. Install the dependencies
```shell
yum install -y tree
yum install -y gcc
yum install -y gcc-c++
yum install -y libzstd-devel
yum install -y make
yum install -y ncurses
yum install -y ncurses-devel
yum install -y bison
yum install -y libaio
yum install -y perl
yum install -y perl-DBI
yum install -y perl-DBD-MySQL
yum install -y perl-Time-HiRes
yum install -y readline-devel
yum install -y numactl
yum install -y zlib
yum install -y zlib-devel
yum install -y openssl
yum install -y openssl-devel
yum install -y redhat-lsb-core
yum install -y git
yum install -y autoconf
yum install -y automake
yum install -y libtool
yum install -y lrzsz
yum install -y lz4
yum install -y lz4-devel
yum install -y snappy
yum install -y snappy-devel
yum install -y bzip2

yum install -y libedit
yum install -y libedit-devel
yum install -y libaio-devel
yum install -y libicu
yum install -y libicu-devel
yum install -y jemalloc-devel
```
### Step 2. Install GCC 9.3.0
Before performing the follow-up steps, you must ensure the GCC version is 9.3.0.<br />You can run the following command to check the GCC version.
```shell
gcc --version
```
If the version is earlier than 9.3.0, perform the following steps to upgrade GCC.

1. Install the SCL utility.
```shell
yum install centos-release-scl scl-utils-build -y
```

2. Install GCC, GCC-C++, or GDB of version 9.3.0.
```shell
yum install devtoolset-9-gcc.x86_64 devtoolset-9-gcc-c++.x86_64 devtoolset-9-gcc-gdb-plugin.x86_64 -y
```

3. Switch the version to 9.3.0.
```shell
scl enable devtoolset-9 bash
```

4. Check that the version is switched to 9.3.0.
```shell
gcc --version
```
### Step 3. Install third-party libraries
Ensure that the CMake version in your environment is 3.7.2 or later and the Make version is 3.82 or later. Otherwise, install CMake, Make, or both of them of the correct versions.
:::info
StoneDB is dependent on marisa, RocksDB, and Boost. You are advised to specify paths for saving the these libraries when you install them, instead of using the default paths.
:::

1. Install CMake.
```shell
wget https://cmake.org/files/v3.7/cmake-3.7.2.tar.gz
tar -zxvf cmake-3.7.2.tar.gz
cd cmake-3.7.2
./bootstrap && make && make install
/usr/local/bin/cmake --version
rm -rf /usr/bin/cmake
ln -s /usr/local/bin/cmake /usr/bin/
cmake --version
```

2. Install Make.
```shell
wget http://mirrors.ustc.edu.cn/gnu/make/make-3.82.tar.gz
tar -zxvf make-3.82.tar.gz
cd make-3.82
./configure  --prefix=/usr/local/make
make && make install
rm -rf /usr/local/bin/make
ln -s /usr/local/make/bin/make /usr/local/bin/make
make --version
```

3. Install marisa.
```shell
git clone https://github.com/s-yata/marisa-trie.git
cd marisa-trie
autoreconf -i
./configure --enable-native-code --prefix=/usr/local/stonedb-marisa
make && make install 
```
The installation directory of marisa in the example is **/usr/local/stonedb-marisa**. You can change it based on your actual conditions.

4. Install RocksDB.
```shell
wget https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/archive/refs/tags/v6.12.6.tar.gz
tar -zxvf v6.12.6.tar.gz
cd rocksdb-6.12.6

cmake ./ \
  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
  -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local/stonedb-gcc-rocksdb \
  -DCMAKE_INSTALL_LIBDIR=/usr/local/stonedb-gcc-rocksdb \
  -DWITH_JEMALLOC=ON \
  -DWITH_SNAPPY=ON \
  -DWITH_LZ4=ON \
  -DWITH_ZLIB=ON \
  -DWITH_ZSTD=ON \
  -DUSE_RTTI=ON \
  -DROCKSDB_BUILD_SHARED=ON \
  -DWITH_GFLAGS=OFF \
  -DWITH_TOOLS=OFF \
  -DWITH_BENCHMARK_TOOLS=OFF \
  -DWITH_CORE_TOOLS=OFF 

make -j`nproc`
make install -j`nproc`
```
The installation directory of RocksDB in the example is **/usr/local/stonedb-gcc-rocksdb**. You can change it based on your actual conditions.

5. Install Boost.
```shell
wget https://sourceforge.net/projects/boost/files/boost/1.66.0/boost_1_66_0.tar.gz
tar -zxvf boost_1_66_0.tar.gz
cd boost_1_66_0
./bootstrap.sh --prefix=/usr/local/stonedb-boost
./b2 install --with=all
```
The installation directory of Boost in the example is **/usr/local/stonedb-boost**. You can change it based on your actual conditions.
:::info
During the compilation, the occurrences of keywords **warning** and** failed** are normal, unless **error** is displayed and the CLI is automatically closed.<br />It takes about 25 minutes to install Boost.
:::

6. Install Gtest.
```shell
git clone https://github.com/google/googletest.git -b release-1.12.0
cd googletest
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -DBUILD_GMOCK=OFF
make
make install
```
Install in /usr/local/ by default.
```shell
ls /usr/local/include/
...... gtest
ls /usr/local/lib/
...... cmake  libgtest.a  libgtest_main.a
```
### Step 4. Compile StoneDB
Currently, StoneDB has two branches: StoneDB-5.6 (for MySQL 5.6) and StoneDB-5.7 (for MySQL 5.7). The link provided in this topic is to the source code package of StoneDB-5.7. In the following example,the source code package is saved to the root directory. 
```shell
cd /
git clone https://github.com/stoneatom/stonedb.git
```
Before compilation, modify the compilation script as follows:

1. Change the installation directory of StoneDB based on your actual conditions. In the example, **/stonedb57/install** is used.
1. Change the installation directories of marisa, RocksDB, and Boost based on your actual conditions.
```shell
### Modify the compilation script.
cd /stonedb/scripts
vim stonedb_build.sh
...
install_target=/stonedb57/install
...
-DDOWNLOAD_BOOST=0 \
-DWITH_BOOST=/usr/local/stonedb-boost/ \
-DWITH_MARISA=/usr/local/stonedb-marisa \
-DWITH_ROCKSDB=/usr/local/stonedb-gcc-rocksdb \
2>&1 | tee -a ${build_log}

### Execute the compilation script.
sh stonedb_build.sh
```
If your OS is CentOS or RHEL, you must comment out **os_dis** and **os_dist_release**, and modify the setting of **build_tag** to exclude the **os_dist** and **os_dist_release** parts. This is because the the values of **Distributor**, **Release**, and **Codename **output of the **lsb_release -a** command are **n/a**. Commenting out **os_dist** and **os_dist_release** only affects the names of the log file and the TAR package and has no impact on the compilation results.
## **Step 5. Start StoneDB**
Users can start StoneDB in two ways: manual installation and automatic installation. 

1. Create an account.
```shell
groupadd mysql
useradd -g mysql mysql
passwd mysql
```

2. Manually install StoneDB.

You need to manually create directories, and then initialize and start StoneDB. You also need to configure parameters in file **my.cnf**, including the installation directories and port.
```shell
### Create directories.
mkdir -p /stonedb57/install/data
mkdir -p /stonedb57/install/binlog
mkdir -p /stonedb57/install/log
mkdir -p /stonedb57/install/tmp
mkdir -p /stonedb57/install/redolog
mkdir -p /stonedb57/install/undolog
chown -R mysql:mysql /stonedb57

### Configure parameters in my.cnf.
mv my.cnf my.cnf.bak
vim /stonedb57/install/my.cnf
[mysqld]
port      = 3306
socket    = /stonedb57/install/tmp/mysql.sock
basedir   = /stonedb57/install
datadir   = /stonedb57/install/data
pid_file  = /stonedb57/install/data/mysqld.pid
log_error = /stonedb57/install/log/mysqld.log
innodb_log_group_home_dir   = /stonedb57/install/redolog/
innodb_undo_directory       = /stonedb57/install/undolog/

chown -R mysql:mysql /stonedb57/install/my.cnf

### Initialize StoneDB.
/stonedb57/install/bin/mysqld --defaults-file=/stonedb57/install/my.cnf --initialize --user=mysql

### Start StoneDB.
/stonedb57/install/bin/mysqld_safe --defaults-file=/stonedb57/install/my.cnf --user=mysql &
```

3. Execute reinstall.sh to automatically install StoneDB.
```shell
cd /stonedb57/install
./reinstall.sh
```
:::info
Differences between **reinstall.sh** and **install.sh**:

- **reinstall.sh** is the script for automatic installation. When the script is being executed, directories are created, and StoneDB is initialized and started. Therefore, do not execute the script unless for the initial startup of StoneDB. Otherwise, all directories will be deleted and StoneDB will be initialized again.
- **install.sh** is the script for manual installation. You can specify the installation directories based on your needs and then execute the script. Same as **reinstall.sh**, when the script is being executed, directories are created, and StoneDB is initialized and started. Therefore, do not execute the script unless for the initial startup. Otherwise, all directories will be deleted and StoneDB will be initialized again.
:::

4. Log in to StoneDB.
```shell
cat /stonedb57/install/log/mysqld.log |grep password
[Note] A temporary password is generated for root@localhost: ceMuEuj6l4+!

/stonedb57/install/bin/mysql -uroot -p -S /stonedb57/install/tmp/mysql.sock
